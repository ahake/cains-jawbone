<p class="itemText">I sit down alone at the appointed table and take up my pen to give all whom it may concern an exact account of what may happen. Call me nervous, call me fey, if you will; at least this little pen, this mottled black and silver Aquarius, with its nib specially tempered to my order in Amsterdam, is greedy. It has not had much work since it flew so nimbly for the dead old man. As I watch the sea, Casy Ferris passes with down-dropped eyes. Of course, to-day is the day.

<p class="itemText">I plunged for the last time. The few remaining figures and letters swam as they came up to me. Then I took them in. There were no more. I glanced about me. I felt I was getting my money’s worth. London is like that; it accepts the wanderer home with a sort of warm indifference. The woman’s beauty was, I surmised, profound; her creamy dress, contrasting with her vivid colouring, showed to me, though more as white against a gay brick sepulchre than snow against roses. Yes it was a dreadful beauty,...</p>

<p class="itemText">At my meeting with Clement yesterday, he had been quite specific: less than twenty thousand yards as average---seventeen thousand six hundred to be exact---full ration of the assassin’s wonderful substance, a little act of justice at the end of less than a week, and then the glorious stuff galore for ever. I felt excellent as I took my second pill. At least I was on my way, for I had come upon the major half of a publishing firm; they had always been very good to me, what with Austin Freeman, Op...</p>

The rain that came heavily is drying off lightly. There, jauntily tripping from the edge of one puddle to another is crisp Sir Roland Mowthalorn, shuddering old thing, intent to buy the day’s buttonhole from gin-faced Annie behind the church.

Thomas Hardy had been, and my doctor uncle in the war had been just the reverse. And I would have to cut out the stops, I realised futilely, for something vaguely Buddhistic. He went on about Browning. I always used Bisto myself, and anyway Henry, the angel, was plying his intended fifth with Emperor’s Peg---equal parts of vitriol and applejac...</p>

Electric Febrifuge may be; but bad for life’s fitful fever. Its active ingredient had finally let me down. I was nothing if not generous. I started my fellow garden enthusiast on the foxgloves.

Now was the hour when Charles Victor Hugo Renard-Beinsky had risen untimely for the sake of the investigating judge. But the very phrase struck chill like the slap of the Firth of Forth above the heart, wading out over the coal dust in the morning. I had investigated; but who would believe an investigator who had not stirred from Baker Steet? I was a judge, but with no sombre little cap, a...</p>

At least I always thought of it as powerful, because I never could quite understand how it worked. I knew I ought to have the body as long as possible. At last I was satisfied. I measured the distance carefully with my eye: a good forty inches, I made it.

The finger causing it was, I knew, the index of a most skilful hand, one I had commanded, one that would pluck me from embarrassment, and yet one I vaguely distrusted. Really, if the lower orders don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of responsibility…. One had to be in the key for such things. I felt I should enjoy it as I got used to it. The bell again, and t...</p>

<p class="itemText">Then came Hyacinth’s day. He laughed when he remembered that, as we were walking round the garden, and said it was too late for Jasmine’s day at any rate. I liked to hear him laugh, and thought it was absurd for him to be called after what the man Boots didn’t understand. The latter’s way of expressing himself seemed to me childish; why should we, of all people, use singular for plural and plural for singular? They went back two days and formulated their bet, till I could have howled. If he got ...</p>

I was, I supposed, an emotional old fool. So I came back and waited in Orchard, it ran through my head, where he cast up blinded that night, which were my true friend Ravager, which were always good to me since we was almost pups, and never minded of my short legs. Very emotional. But there was no need for me to weep just at the ...</p>

My vis-à-vis hadn’t a bad head, now I came to consider it, bowed over the documents. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case. I became a trifle abstracted. What, I wondered, would he have said about an abstracted will? He might answer to the same name as the man who sang: “Ah, are you digging on m...</p>

Then seeing, or thinking he saw, his mistake, he answered: “You must do just as you think fit, May.” After all it was none of my business. Some fragments of dejected flesh still lay among the rests of the spilled wine. At my sign, Henry stooped and made all clean again. And there was no immediate call ...</p>

<p class="itemText">Now, I considered, in my dear Lyons it would be coming of age hours, and I wondered if they would ever do that over here. I fancied what self-consciousness and preciosity there would be, for instance, if the B.B.C. ever took it up. A strange institution; but the nursed fuse was always interesting. Yes, if sitting at the familiar table with Bart chewing at my moccasins, I could have broadcast it all, I would have left the mighty heart of England to deal with it.

<p class="itemText">I discussed certain passages with the man, and he was too guardedly ignorant in his contributions to our discussion. The chapter on the fall of the rupee you may omit. It is somewhat too sensational. Even these metallic problems have their melodramatic side. But would I have called him to me had it not been for money? Many a truth had been spoken, I reflected, as an epigram. Like something very far away in a great disused house, that may to the aching ear seem to be lifting a flag in some disuse...</p>

Through it, handsome, cadaverous and so quiet, had walked Death himself, tapping unnoticed at the very walls of the mansions of life; trying here, failing there, lightly fingering for the sign of a breach. A tiny opening. Apparently the person who slept in the lock-up at that county town on the Severn, or perhaps woke, would hear this time. I had found that I could face my usu...</p>

I drew a volume from my pocket; blind-tooled on the green in a double circle was a single star above what was perhaps a sea. I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present.

<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Had not the author of Wails of a Tayside Inn said of them that they were the living poems and that all the rest were dead? Had not the winger of Wimpole Street said that they were binding up their hearts away from breaking with a cerement of the grave? Anyway their hour had come and was now ov...</p>

<p class="itemText">Naturally I looked up. And I tell you I found it awe-inspiring enough to actually see my own name through the window, printed there in great letters for the gaze of all and sundry. With a blush I concentrated again on Henry, and asked myself if his recent activities did or did not constitute the darbs. With a final flirt at the fringe, the other tapped and scattered the saintly ashes. Agriculture was to take back her own, it seemed, and I rejoiced to have my last night of the bent broad back. I ...</p>

<p class="itemText">I knew, of course, that if I got there in five minutes I would have double the time for my by no means suburban hops at the Café Royal, without insulting it and myself with John Montagu’s arrangement for an uninterrupted session at the gaming table. I felt so much at one with Holy Mr. Herbert. Or Mr. Haddock did he call himself? But he was right about these hours, and if that was not holiness, what was? Meed kissing laces, surely he had convulsed us with. For the moment it didn’t matter. Because...</p>

<p class="itemText">Now I think I will try a cup of what they insolently call Golden Tips, a find young Tippy Tea. And then they say specifically No Tips. It is very disheartening. While I am waiting for it, and for the possible her, I study the only literature before me. What is a Loganberry Kiss? Is it at all like the Plover’s Lunch, that hurts and is desired? It is strange to think that Catharine is even at this moment turning a Somerset in front of the altar. The whole business reminds me of the time we lay out...</p>

<p class="itemText">To have slept and to wake right up surrounded by an atmosphere in which Bunny and Perry went at it hammer and tongs, seemed almost sacrilege. That was the day when I was going to do a thing I had never done before. I looked at Henry, and felt a little sick. I took two pills. I had too soon---perhaps I did not want to go even so quickly as my ordered slowness---exchanged a tennis venue for a rowing one. I was not in Dorset; but I murmured to myself that Ellen Brine of Allenburn would never mwore ...</p>

<p class="itemText">He stood and looked down at me; but I was not to be hurried. The money changed hands slowly; for I wished to be able to describe him. He seems to have had a great confidence in the opinion of his physicians. I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. But there were doctors and doctors, I would have to think seriously of that. And then he went. He went. Simple faith or Norman bluff? But that Douglas was, perha...</p>

<p class="itemText">And she wore a mauve love-knot on her breast, and the ends were unequal. He said he’d put that right, but he couldn't find the silly old jossers, as Jasmine might so easily have called them. I was old enough to remember her; she wasn’t the one I’d killed. He had read out about some most excellent potent brilliant eyes, swift-darting as the stars, steadfast as the sun; grey, we said, of the azure-grey colour; large enough, not of glaring size; the habitual expression of them vigilance and penetra...</p>

<p class="itemText">I dimly guess why the old dead so wanted this. I had worked for him, Henry had worked for him. If I could get up, as, believe me, I cannot, I would have a thing to say to her. She lolls over at me gloating, her mouth blood-tinted on the puma freckle of her beauty. Why should I think of Henry at this particular juncture? I have it. Scotland Yard, of course. And little ‘twill matter to one. A sorry thing to be last noticed: the buttonhole has escaped from the buttonholer. He, the reckless old cock...</p>

What chemistry! That the winds are really not infectious. Now that I was approaching journey\'92s end, I began to ask myself disconcerting questions. It would be terrible if she turned out to be Flecker\'92s one. And some to Flecker turn to pray, and I toward thy bed. But I had probably got it wrong. Yet it was all right.

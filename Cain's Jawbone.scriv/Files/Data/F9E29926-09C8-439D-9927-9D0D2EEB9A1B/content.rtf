The sound of the bell, as of a boding gnat, just came to me. The finger causing it was, I knew, the index of a most skilful hand, one I had commanded, one that would pluck me from embarrassment, and yet one I vaguely distrusted. Really, if the lower orders don\'92t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of responsibility\'85. One had to be in the key for such things. I felt I should enjoy it as I got used to it. The bell again, and then a far sensation of feet. I was glad the man had come; time was not unlimited. I remembered that, when I was returning after a fortnight\'92s absence during which my assistant Charles Day had deputised for me in my lectures on mineralogy at Peebles University, a tactless hand had left on the blackboard: \'93Let us work while it is yet Day; for the Knight cometh when no man can work.\'94\
